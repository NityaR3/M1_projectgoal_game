In C programming
Code has a random function that generates ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’. Every time (loop or round) code display who wins 
(i.e. if you enter ‘r’ (actually ‘1’) and computer or random function generate ‘s’ then code display, ‘You Got It!‘). 
After 3 rounds who won more round will win the game. In every round score counter increase by 1 if anyone wins that round. 
If in any round you and computer generate the same character then code display ‘It’s a draw. Both got 1 point!‘ and 
if the final score will the same then you need to play again and code shows ‘It’s a draw’.
